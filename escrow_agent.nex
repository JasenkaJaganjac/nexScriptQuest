/*
This smart contract allows secure transactions between two parties by using 
an escrow agent. The escrow agent holds the funds until the predefined
conditions are met. If the conditions are met, the funds are released to the
seller; if not, they are returned to the buyer. 

This contract is designed for use cases where trust is required between 
parties who may not know each other, with an added timeout mechanism to prevent 
funds from being locked indefinitely.
